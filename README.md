# MGcount
MGcount is a program for counting whole-transcriptome RNA-seq reads
from one or more input alignment files (.bam). It is specially designed to
incorporate multi-mapping and multi-overlapping reads in the
quantification using a flexible methodology that is compatible with any
biotype. At the end of its execution, it produces a count matrix,
compatible with any downstream analysis.

## Requirements
MGcount deppends on FeatureCounts. Please download it from the following link: http://subread.sourceforge.net/

## Installation
MGcount is written in Python and is executed from the command line. You can either download the executable version (single binary file) or install it as a Python3 module. 

### Install and run as a Python3 module
You can install the package as a Python module:

```shell
pip3 install git+https://github.com/hitaandrea/MGcount.git
```
Once the package is installed, run the tool as a Python installed module:

```shell
python3 -m mgcount [args]
```

### Download and run the executable program

Alternatively can download the latest release as a binary executable file [here](https://github.com/hitaandrea/MGcount/releases/download/v1.1.0/MGcount). 

Save the program file to your Linux system and set the permissions to allow executing the file as program:

```shell
chmod +x mgcount
```

Once the file is executable, run the tool by calling the file from the command line with the desired arguments.

```shell
MGcount [args]
```
